# Upgrading the RDS for Oracle DB engine<a name="USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Oracle"></a>

When Amazon RDS supports a new version of Oracle, you can upgrade your DB instances to the new version\. For information about which Oracle versions are available on Amazon RDS, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/OracleReleaseNotes/Welcome.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/OracleReleaseNotes/Welcome.html)\.

**Important**  
RDS for Oracle Database 11g is deprecated\. If you maintain Oracle Database 11g snapshots, you can upgrade them to a later release\. For more information, see [Upgrading an Oracle DB snapshot](USER_UpgradeDBSnapshot.Oracle.md)\.
