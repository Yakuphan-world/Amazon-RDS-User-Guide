# Sharing a DB snapshot<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot"></a>

Using Amazon RDS, you can share a manual DB snapshot in the following ways:
+ Sharing a manual DB snapshot, whether encrypted or unencrypted, enables authorized AWS accounts to copy the snapshot\.
+ Sharing an unencrypted manual DB snapshot enables authorized AWS accounts to directly restore a DB instance from the snapshot instead of taking a copy of it and restoring from that\. However, you can't restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot that is both shared and encrypted\. Instead, you can make a copy of the DB snapshot and restore the DB instance from the copy\.

**Note**  
To share an automated DB snapshot, create a manual DB snapshot by copying the automated snapshot, and then share that copy\. This process also applies to AWS Backupâ€“generated resources\.

For more information on copying a snapshot, see [Copying a DB snapshot](USER_CopySnapshot.md)\. For more information on restoring a DB instance from a DB snapshot, see [Restoring from a DB snapshot](USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.md)\.

You can share a manual snapshot with up to 20 other AWS accounts\.

The following limitations apply when sharing manual snapshots with other AWS accounts:
+ When you restore a DB instance from a shared snapshot using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) or Amazon RDS API, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the shared snapshot as the snapshot identifier\.
+ You can't share a DB snapshot that uses an option group with permanent or persistent options, except for Oracle DB instances that have the `Timezone` or `OLS` option \(or both\)\.

  A *permanent option* can't be removed from an option group\. Option groups with persistent options can't be removed from a DB instance once the option group has been assigned to the DB instance\.

  The following table lists permanent and persistent options and their related DB engines\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ShareSnapshot.html)

  For Oracle DB instances, you can copy shared DB snapshots that have the `Timezone` or `OLS` option \(or both\)\. To do so, specify a target option group that includes these options when you copy the DB snapshot\. The OLS option is permanent and persistent only for Oracle DB instances running Oracle version 12\.2 or higher\. For more information about these options, see [Oracle time zone](Appendix.Oracle.Options.Timezone.md) and [Oracle Label Security](Oracle.Options.OLS.md)\.



## Sharing public snapshots<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Public"></a>

You can also share an unencrypted manual snapshot as public, which makes the snapshot available to all AWS accounts\. Make sure when sharing a snapshot as public that none of your private information is included in the public snapshot\.

When a snapshot is shared publicly, it gives all AWS accounts permission both to copy the snapshot and to create DB instances from it\.

You aren't billed for the backup storage of public snapshots owned by other accounts\. You're billed only for snapshots that you own\.

If you copy a public snapshot, you own the copy\. You're billed for the backup storage of your snapshot copy\. If you create a DB instance from a public snapshot, you're billed for that DB instance\. For Amazon RDS pricing information, see the [Amazon RDS product page](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing)\.

You can delete only the public snapshots that you own\. To delete a shared or public snapshot, make sure to log into the AWS account that owns the snapshot\.

### Viewing public snapshots owned by other AWS accounts<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Public.View.Console"></a>

You can view public snapshots owned by other accounts in a particular AWS Region on the **Public** tab of the **Snapshots** page in the Amazon RDS console\. Your snapshots \(those owned by your account\) don't appear on this tab\.

**To view public snapshots**

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**\.

1. Choose the **Public** tab\.

   The public snapshots appear\. You can see which account owns a public snapshot in the **Owner** column\.
**Note**  
You might have to modify the page preferences, by selecting the gear icon at the upper right of the **Public snapshots** list, to see this column\.

### Viewing your own public snapshots<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Public.View.CLI"></a>

You can use the following AWS CLI command \(Unix only\) to view the public snapshots owned by your AWS account in a particular AWS Region\.

```
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --snapshot-type public --include-public | grep account_number
```

The output returned is similar to the following example if you have public snapshots\.

```
"DBSnapshotArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:snapshot:mysnapshot1",
"DBSnapshotArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:snapshot:mysnapshot2",
```

**Note**  
You might see duplicate entries for `DBSnapshotIdentifier` or `SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier`\.

## Sharing encrypted snapshots<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Encrypted"></a>

You can share DB snapshots that have been encrypted "at rest" using the AES\-256 encryption algorithm, as described in [Encrypting Amazon RDS resources](Overview.Encryption.md)\. To do this, take the following steps:

1. Share the AWS KMS key that was used to encrypt the snapshot with any accounts that you want to be able to access the snapshot\.

   You can share KMS keys with another AWS account by adding the other account to the KMS key policy\. For details on updating a key policy, see [Key policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the *AWS KMS Developer Guide*\. For an example of creating a key policy, see [Allowing access to an AWS KMS key](#USER_ShareSnapshot.Encrypted.KeyPolicy) later in this topic\.

1. Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API to share the encrypted snapshot with the other accounts\.

These restrictions apply to sharing encrypted snapshots:
+ You can't share encrypted snapshots as public\.
+ You can't share Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server snapshots that are encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption \(TDE\)\.
+ You can't share a snapshot that has been encrypted using the default KMS key of the AWS account that shared the snapshot\. 

### Allowing access to an AWS KMS key<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Encrypted.KeyPolicy"></a>

For another AWS account to copy an encrypted DB snapshot shared from your account, the account that you share your snapshot with must have access to the AWS KMS key that encrypted the snapshot\. 

To allow another AWS account access to a KMS key, update the key policy for the KMS key\. You update it with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the AWS account that you are sharing to as `Principal` in the KMS key policy\. Then you allow the `kms:CreateGrant` action\.

After you have given an AWS account access to your KMS key, to copy your encrypted snapshot that AWS account must create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role or user if it doesn't already have one\. In addition, that AWS account must also attach an IAM policy to that IAM permission set or roles that allows the permission set or roles to copy an encrypted DB snapshot using your KMS key\. The account must be an IAM user and can't be a root AWS account identity due to AWS KMS security restrictions\.

In the following key policy example, user `111122223333` is the owner of the KMS key, and user `444455556666` is the account that the key is being shared with\. This updated key policy gives the AWS account access to the KMS key by including the ARN for the root AWS account identity for user `444455556666` as a `Principal` for the policy, and by allowing the `kms:CreateGrant` action\. 

```
{
  "Id": "key-policy-1",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": [
        "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/KeyUser",
        "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"
      ]},
      "Action": [
        "kms:CreateGrant",
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Allow attachment of persistent resources",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": [
        "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/KeyUser",
        "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"
      ]},
      "Action": [
        "kms:CreateGrant",
        "kms:ListGrants",
        "kms:RevokeGrant"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {"Bool": {"kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": true}}
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Creating an IAM policy to enable copying of the encrypted snapshot<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Encrypted.KeyPolicy.IAM"></a>

Once the external AWS account has access to your KMS key, the owner of that AWS account can create a policy that allows an IAM user created for that account to copy an encrypted snapshot encrypted with that KMS key\.

The following example shows a policy that can be attached to an IAM user for AWS account `444455556666` that enables the IAM user to copy a shared snapshot from AWS account `111122223333` that has been encrypted with the KMS key `c989c1dd-a3f2-4a5d-8d96-e793d082ab26` in the `us-west-2` region\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowUseOfTheKey",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:CreateGrant",
                "kms:RetireGrant"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/c989c1dd-a3f2-4a5d-8d96-e793d082ab26"]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAttachmentOfPersistentResources",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:CreateGrant",
                "kms:ListGrants",
                "kms:RevokeGrant"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/c989c1dd-a3f2-4a5d-8d96-e793d082ab26"],
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": true
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Sharing a snapshot<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Sharing"></a>

You can share a DB snapshot using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

### Console<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.Console"></a>

Using the Amazon RDS console, you can share a manual DB snapshot with up to 20 AWS accounts\. You can also use the console to stop sharing a manual snapshot with one or more accounts\.

**To share a manual DB snapshot by using the Amazon RDS console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**\.

1. Select the manual snapshot that you want to share\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Share snapshot**\.

1. Choose one of the following options for **DB snapshot visibility**\.
   + If the source is unencrypted, choose **Public** to permit all AWS accounts to restore a DB instance from your manual DB snapshot, or choose **Private** to permit only AWS accounts that you specify to restore a DB instance from your manual DB snapshot\.
**Warning**  
If you set **DB snapshot visibility** to **Public**, all AWS accounts can restore a DB instance from your manual DB snapshot and have access to your data\. Do not share any manual DB snapshots that contain private information as **Public**\.
   + If the source is encrypted, **DB snapshot visibility** is set as **Private** because encrypted snapshots can't be shared as public\.

1. For **AWS Account ID**, type the AWS account identifier for an account that you want to permit to restore a DB instance from your manual snapshot, and then choose **Add**\. Repeat to include additional AWS account identifiers, up to 20 AWS accounts\.

   If you make an error when adding an AWS account identifier to the list of permitted accounts, you can delete it from the list by choosing **Delete** at the right of the incorrect AWS account identifier\.  
![\[Permit AWS accounts to restore a manual DB snapshot\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ShareSnapshot_add.png)

1. After you have added identifiers for all of the AWS accounts that you want to permit to restore the manual snapshot, choose **Save** to save your changes\.

**To stop sharing a manual DB snapshot with an AWS account**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**\.

1. Select the manual snapshot that you want to stop sharing\.

1. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Share snapshot**\.

1. To remove permission for an AWS account, choose **Delete** for the AWS account identifier for that account from the list of authorized accounts\.  
![\[Permit AWS accounts to restore a manual DB snapshot\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ShareSnapshot_delete.png)

1. Choose **Save** to save your changes\.

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.CLI"></a>

To share a DB snapshot, use the `aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute` command\. Use the `--values-to-add` parameter to add a list of the IDs for the AWS accounts that are authorized to restore the manual snapshot\.

**Example of sharing a snapshot with a single account**  
The following example enables AWS account identifier `123456789012` to restore the DB snapshot named `db7-snapshot`\.  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute \
--db-snapshot-identifier db7-snapshot \
--attribute-name restore \
--values-to-add 123456789012
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute ^
--db-snapshot-identifier db7-snapshot ^
--attribute-name restore ^
--values-to-add 123456789012
```

**Example of sharing a snapshot with multiple accounts**  
The following example enables two AWS account identifiers, `111122223333` and `444455556666`, to restore the DB snapshot named `manual-snapshot1`\.  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute \
--db-snapshot-identifier manual-snapshot1 \
--attribute-name restore \
--values-to-add {"111122223333","444455556666"}
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute ^
--db-snapshot-identifier manual-snapshot1 ^
--attribute-name restore ^
--values-to-add "[\"111122223333\",\"444455556666\"]"
```
When using the Windows command prompt, you must escape double quotes \("\) in JSON code by prefixing them with a backslash \(\\\)\.

To remove an AWS account identifier from the list, use the `--values-to-remove` parameter\.

**Example of stopping snapshot sharing**  
The following example prevents AWS account ID 444455556666 from restoring the snapshot\.  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute \
--db-snapshot-identifier manual-snapshot1 \
--attribute-name restore \
--values-to-remove 444455556666
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds modify-db-snapshot-attribute ^
--db-snapshot-identifier manual-snapshot1 ^
--attribute-name restore ^
--values-to-remove 444455556666
```

To list the AWS accounts enabled to restore a snapshot, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-snapshot-attributes.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-snapshot-attributes.html) AWS CLI command\.

### RDS API<a name="USER_ShareSnapshot.API"></a>

You can also share a manual DB snapshot with other AWS accounts by using the Amazon RDS API\. To do so, call the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute.html) operation\. Specify `restore` for `AttributeName`, and use the `ValuesToAdd` parameter to add a list of the IDs for the AWS accounts that are authorized to restore the manual snapshot\. 

To make a manual snapshot public and restorable by all AWS accounts, use the value `all`\. However, take care not to add the `all` value for any manual snapshots that contain private information that you don't want to be available to all AWS accounts\. Also, don't specify `all` for encrypted snapshots, because making such snapshots public isn't supported\.

To remove sharing permission for an AWS account, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute.html) operation with `AttributeName` set to `restore` and the `ValuesToRemove` parameter\. To mark a manual snapshot as private, remove the value `all` from the values list for the `restore` attribute\.

To list all of the AWS accounts permitted to restore a snapshot, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes.html) API operation\.
