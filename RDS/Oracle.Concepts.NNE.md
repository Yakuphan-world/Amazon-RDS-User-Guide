# Using native network encryption with an RDS for Oracle DB instance<a name="Oracle.Concepts.NNE"></a>

Oracle Database offers two ways to encrypt data over the network: native network encryption \(NNE\) and Transport Layer Security \(TLS\)\. NNE is a proprietary Oracle security feature, whereas TLS is an industry standard\. RDS for Oracle supports NNE for all editions of Oracle Database\.

NNE has the following advantages over TLS:
+ You can control NNE on the client and server using settings in the NNE option:
  + `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO_CLIENTS` and `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO`
  + `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER`
  + `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER`
  + `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER`
  + `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER`
+ In most cases, you don't need to configure your client or server\. In contrast, TSL requires you to configure both client and server\.
+ No certificates are required\. In TLS, the server requires a certificate \(which eventually expires\), and the client requires a trusted root certificate for the certificate authority that issued the serverâ€™s certificate\.

To enable NNE encryption for an Oracle DB instance, add the Oracle NNE option to the option group associated with the DB instance\. For more information, see [Oracle native network encryption](Appendix.Oracle.Options.NetworkEncryption.md)\. 

**Note**  
You can't use both NNE and TLS on the same DB instance\.
