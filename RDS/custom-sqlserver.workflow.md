# RDS Custom for SQL Server workflow<a name="custom-sqlserver.workflow"></a>

The following diagram shows the typical workflow for RDS Custom for SQL Server\.

![\[RDS Custom for SQL Server architecture\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/./images/custom_sqlserver_architecture_v2.png)

The steps are as follows:

1. Create an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance from an engine version offered by RDS Custom\.

   For more information, see [Creating an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance](custom-creating-sqlserver.md#custom-creating-sqlserver.create)\.

1. Connect your application to the RDS Custom DB instance endpoint\.

   For more information, see [Connecting to your RDS Custom DB instance using AWS Systems Manager](custom-creating-sqlserver.md#custom-creating-sqlserver.ssm) and [Connecting to your RDS Custom DB instance using RDP](custom-creating-sqlserver.md#custom-creating-sqlserver.rdp)\.

1. \(Optional\) Access the host to customize your software\.

1. Monitor notifications and messages generated by RDS Custom automation\.

## Creating a DB instance for RDS Custom<a name="custom-sqlserver.workflow.instance"></a>

You create your RDS Custom DB instance using the `create-db-instance` command\. The procedure is similar to creating an Amazon RDS instance\. However, some of the parameters are different\. For more information, see [Creating and connecting to a DB instance for Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server](custom-creating-sqlserver.md)\.

## Database connection<a name="custom-sqlserver.workflow.db-connection"></a>

Like an Amazon RDS DB instance, your RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance resides in a VPC\. Your application connects to the RDS Custom instance using a client such as SQL Server Management Suite \(SSMS\), just as in RDS for SQL Server\.

## RDS Custom customization<a name="custom-sqlserver.workflow.customization"></a>

You can access the RDS Custom host to install or customize software\. To avoid conflicts between your changes and the RDS Custom automation, you can pause the automation for a specified period\. During this period, RDS Custom doesn't perform monitoring or instance recovery\. At the end of the period, RDS Custom resumes full automation\. For more information, see [Pausing and resuming RDS Custom automation](custom-managing-sqlserver.md#custom-managing-sqlserver.pausing)\.
