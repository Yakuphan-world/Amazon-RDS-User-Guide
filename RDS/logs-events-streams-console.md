# Viewing logs, events, and streams in the Amazon RDS console<a name="logs-events-streams-console"></a>

Amazon RDS integrates with AWS services to show information about logs, events, and database activity streams in the RDS console\.

The **Logs & events** tab for your RDS DB instance shows the following information:
+ **Amazon CloudWatch alarms** – Shows any metric alarms that you have configured for the DB instance\. If you haven't configured alarms, you can create them in the RDS console\. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon RDS metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md)\.
+ **Recent events** – Shows a summary of events \(environment changes\) for your RDS DB instance \. For more information, see [Viewing Amazon RDS events](USER_ListEvents.md)\.
+ **Logs** – Shows database log files generated by a DB instance\. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon RDS log files](USER_LogAccess.md)\.

The **Configuration** tab displays information about database activity streams\.
