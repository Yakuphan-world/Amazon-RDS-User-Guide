# Securing connections to RDS for PostgreSQL with SSL/TLS<a name="PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.Security"></a>

RDS for PostgreSQL supports Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\) encryption for PostgreSQL DB instances\. Using SSL, you can encrypt a PostgreSQL connection between your applications and your PostgreSQL DB instances\. You can also force all connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance to use SSL\. RDS for PostgreSQL also supports Transport Layer Security \(TLS\), the successor protocol to SSL\.

To learn more about Amazon RDS and data protection, including encrypting connections using SSL/TLS, see [Data protection in Amazon RDS](DataDurability.md)\.
