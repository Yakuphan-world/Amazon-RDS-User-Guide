# Planning where to use RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-planning"></a>

 You can determine which of your DB instances, clusters, and applications might benefit the most from using RDS Proxy\. To do so, consider these factors: 
+  Any DB instance or cluster that encounters "too many connections" errors is a good candidate for associating with a proxy\. The proxy enables applications to open many client connections, while the proxy manages a smaller number of long\-lived connections to the DB instance or cluster\. 
+  For DB instances or clusters that use smaller AWS instance classes, such as T2 or T3, using a proxy can help avoid out\-of\-memory conditions\. It can also help reduce the CPU overhead for establishing connections\. These conditions can occur when dealing with large numbers of connections\. 
+  You can monitor certain Amazon CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance or cluster is approaching certain types of limit\. These limits are for the number of connections and the memory associated with connection management\. You can also monitor certain CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance or cluster is handling many short\-lived connections\. Opening and closing such connections can impose performance overhead on your database\. For information about the metrics to monitor, see [Monitoring RDS Proxy metrics with Amazon CloudWatchMonitoring RDS Proxy with CloudWatch](rds-proxy.monitoring.md)\. 
+  AWS Lambda functions can also be good candidates for using a proxy\. These functions make frequent short database connections that benefit from connection pooling offered by RDS Proxy\. You can take advantage of any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code\. 
+  Applications that typically open and close large numbers of database connections and don't have built\-in connection pooling mechanisms are good candidates for using a proxy\. 
+  Applications that keep a large number of connections open for long periods are typically good candidates for using a proxy\. Applications in industries such as software as a service \(SaaS\) or ecommerce often minimize the latency for database requests by leaving connections open\. With RDS Proxy, an application can keep more connections open than it can when connecting directly to the DB instance or cluster\. 
+  You might not have adopted IAM authentication and Secrets Manager due to the complexity of setting up such authentication for all DB instances and clusters\. If so, you can leave the existing authentication methods in place and delegate the authentication to a proxy\. The proxy can enforce the authentication policies for client connections for particular applications\. You can take advantage of any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code\. 
+  RDS Proxy can help make applications more resilient and transparent to database failures\. RDS Proxy bypasses Domain Name System \(DNS\) caches to reduce failover times by up to 66% for Amazon RDS Multi\-AZ databases\. RDS Proxy also automatically routes traffic to a new database instance while preserving application connections\. This makes failovers more transparent for applications\.
