# Maximum CPU<a name="USER_PerfInsights.Overview.MaxCPU"></a>

In the dashboard, the **Database load** chart collects, aggregates, and displays session information\. To see whether active sessions are exceeding the maximum CPU, look at their relationship to the **Max vCPU** line\. The **Max vCPU** value is determined by the number of vCPU \(virtual CPU\) cores for your DB instance\. 

One process can run on a vCPU at a time\. If the number of processes exceed the number of vCPUs, the processes start queuing\. When the queuing increase, the performance is impacted\. If the DB load is often above the **Max vCPU** line, and the primary wait state is CPU, the CPU is overloaded\. In this case, you might want to throttle connections to the instance, tune any SQL queries with a high CPU load, or consider a larger instance class\. High and consistent instances of any wait state indicate that there might be bottlenecks or resource contention issues to resolve\. This can be true even if the DB load doesn't cross the **Max vCPU** line\.
