# Using a custom DNS server for outbound network access<a name="Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.CustomDNS"></a>

RDS for PostgreSQL supports outbound network access on your DB instances and allows Domain Name Service \(DNS\) resolution from a custom DNS server owned by the customer\. You can resolve only fully qualified domain names from your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance through your custom DNS server\.

## Turning on custom DNS resolution<a name="Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.CustomDNS.Enable"></a>

To turn on DNS resolution in your customer VPC, first associate a custom DB parameter group to your RDS for PostgreSQL instance\. Then turn on the `rds.custom_dns_resolution` parameter by setting it to 1, and then restart the DB instance for the changes to take place\. 

## Turning off custom DNS resolution<a name="Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.CustomDNS.Disable"></a>

To turn off DNS resolution in your customer VPC, first turn off the `rds.custom_dns_resolution` parameter of your custom DB parameter group by setting it to 0\. Then restart the DB instance for the changes to take place\.

## Setting up a custom DNS server<a name="Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.CustomDNS.Setup"></a>

After you set up your custom DNS name server, it takes up to 30 minutes to propagate the changes to your DB instance\. After the changes are propagated to your DB instance, all outbound network traffic requiring a DNS lookup queries your DNS server over port 53\.

**Note**  
If you don't set up a custom DNS server and `rds.custom_dns_resolution` is set to 1, hosts are resolved using an Amazon RouteÂ 53 private zone\. For more information, see [Working with private hosted zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html)\.

**To set up a custom DNS server for your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance**

1. From the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \(DHCP\) options set attached to your VPC, set the `domain-name-servers` option to the IP address of your DNS name server\. For more information, see [DHCP options sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html)\. 
**Note**  
The `domain-name-servers` option accepts up to four values, but your Amazon RDS DB instance uses only the first value\. 

1. Ensure that your DNS server can resolve all lookup queries, including public DNS names, Amazon EC2 private DNS names, and customer\-specific DNS names\. If the outbound network traffic contains any DNS lookups that your DNS server can't handle, your DNS server must have appropriate upstream DNS providers configured\. 

1. Configure your DNS server to produce User Datagram Protocol \(UDP\) responses of 512 bytes or less\. 

1. Configure your DNS server to produce Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\) responses of 1,024 bytes or less\. 

1. Configure your DNS server to allow inbound traffic from your Amazon RDS DB instances over port 53\. If your DNS server is in an Amazon VPC, the VPC must have a security group that contains inbound rules that allow UDP and TCP traffic on port 53\. If your DNS server is not in an Amazon VPC, it must have appropriate firewall settings to allow UDP and TCP inbound traffic on port 53\. 

   For more information, see [Security groups for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) and [Adding and removing rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#AddRemoveRules)\. 

1. Configure the VPC of your Amazon RDS DB instance to allow outbound traffic over port 53\. Your VPC must have a security group that contains outbound rules that allow UDP and TCP traffic on port 53\. 

   For more information, see [Security groups for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) and [Adding and removing rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#AddRemoveRules) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 

1. Make sure that the routing path between the Amazon RDS DB instance and the DNS server is configured correctly to allow DNS traffic\. 

   Also, if the Amazon RDS DB instance and the DNS server are not in the same VPC, make sure that a peering connection is set up between them\. For more information, see [What is VPC peering?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/Welcome.html) in *Amazon VPC Peering Guide*\.
